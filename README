## Setup

1. Create new VM for access point (Ubuntu 22.04 has good support for WiFi-hardware)
2. Add one network interface for management (e.g. NAT with host)
3. Add one network interface for access point traffic (e.g. VLAN10)
4. Add wireless hardware to VM and check that it appears in `dmesg`
5. Run `setup.sh`
6. Connect to the new AP and you should see the traffic
